            As you can tell from the picture, I LOVE PIZZA! I have two brothers currently serving in the United States Army 
            and the United States Navy. This picture was taken when I visited my brother in Chicago, where we went to a local pizza 
            restaurant called Giordano's Pizza. If you're ever visiting Chicago and are unsure about what to eat for lunch, I highly recommend 
            Giordano's! The service is incredible, and although you may have to wait 45 minutes for their deep-dish pizza, I promise it's worth the wait!

            Now, let me share a bit about myself. I am a graduate student pursuing an M.Sc. in Applied Mathematics and a Ph.D. in AI/ML. 
            I also hold a B.Sc. in Biological Sciences with a specialization in Biomedical Studies. My ultimate goal is to become a professor and researcher, merging the fields of 
            Applied Mathematics and AI/ML with the biomedical world. My primary research interest lies in the enhancement of prosthetics using AI/ML, 
            particularly in conjunction with neural networks. Someday, I hope to create something as iconic as the four arms used by Doc Ock in Spider-Man!

        <p class="about_paragraph">
            My passion for teaching began during my undergraduate years when I tutored as a part-time job. It sparked my love for education, which eventually led me to my current 
            role as an instructor teaching AP Precalculus. Over the past two years, I’ve observed a trend: students often focus more on achieving perfect grades than on the learning process itself. 
            This approach stems from the intense emphasis many school districts place on results over the educational experience, inadvertently shaping students' attitudes toward learning.
        </p>
        <p class="about_paragraph">
            This mindset often carries over to higher education, where students expect similar outcomes-driven approaches. However, as coursework becomes more specialized and challenging, 
            many abandon their academic pursuits. While some may rely on tools like ChatGPT to get by, they may struggle later in environments where critical thinking and creativity are indispensable.
        </p>
        <p class="about_paragraph">
            That’s where this program comes in! My goal is not just to tutor but to help you develop critical thinking skills and foster your imagination. Together, 
            we can prepare you to become that kick ass doctor, engineer, research scientist, computer scientist, etc. that comes up with the next big thing! 
            Take charge of your education and schedule a session with me today—I look forward to helping you succeed!
